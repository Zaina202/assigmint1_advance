# Review for assigmint1
I made a parent class call Student with three childern : Medical , Master and Engineering wiche they has some common member and method that give them IS-A relationship ,
Ialso used @override in the class to rewrite some function that is common between the class but needed some changes to suits each subclass.
In the main i made a menu that give you some operation choices to execute on student class like add , remove , retrieve and another menu when you chose add to see wiche kind of student you want to add because each one of these kind has differint members and attributes than the other , so you enter the information then it is assigned to the object by the Parameterized Constructor except some member that assigned by setter method like BA .
